	Abstract = {Matlab programs that solve nonlinear equations and minimize using quasi-Newton with BFGS update. The programs are somewhat more robust, apparently, than the stock Matlab programs that do about the same thing. The minimizer can negotiate discontinuous \&quot;cliffs\&quot; without getting stuck. This directory contains a set of matlab m files that do unconstrained optimization and nonlinear equations-solving. It also contains some auxiliary m files. csminwel: minimization. Uses a quasi-Newton method with BFGS update of the estimated inverse hessian. It is robust against certain pathologies common on likelihood functions. It attempts to be robust against \&quot;cliffs\&quot;, i.e. hyperplane discontinuities, though it is not really clear whether what it does in such cases succeeds reliably. csminit: called by csminwel. numgrad: crude numerical derivative. Called by csminwel if no analytic gradient supplied. Beware of this or any other numerical derivative on large or ill-conditioned problems. bfgsi: The BFGS update for the inverse hessian. csolve: nonlinear equation solver. More robust than many. Tries random search directions if things look bad and will not get stuck at a flat spot in the sum of deviations objective function that is not a solution},

	Abstract = {{This thesis incorporates a mixed discrete/continuous parameter genetic algorithm optimization capability into the Design Optimization/Markov Evaluation (DOME) program developed by the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory of Cambridge, Massachusetts. DOME combines the merits of Markov modeling and the Optimal Design Process to generate a systematic framework for system design with realistic reliability and cost analyses. The addition of genetic algorithms expands the design problem domain to include discrete parameter problems, which current optimization methods continue to struggle with. A new variant of the genetic algorithm called the steady-state genetic algorithm is introduced to eliminate the idea of distinct generations. Functional constraints are dealt with by ingenious use of the function information contained in the genetic algorithm population. The optimal genetic algorithm parameter settings are investigated, and the genetic algorithm is compared to the Monte Carlo method and the Branch and Bound method to show its relative utility in optimization. This research shows that a single criterion genetic algorithm can be expected to outperform other methods in efficiency, accuracy, and speed on problems of moderate to high complexity. The work then extends to multicriteria optimization, as applied to fault tolerant system design. A multicriteria genetic algorithm is created as a competitive means of generating the efficient (Pareto) set. Method parameters such as cloning, sharing, domination pressure, and population variability are investigated. The method is compared to the epsilon-constraint multi criteria method with a steady-state genetic algorithm performing the underlying single-criterion optimization.}},

A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods.},

@book{Dantzig63,
	Abstract = {{<p>In real-world problems related to finance, business, and management, mathematicians and economists frequently encounter optimization problems. In this classic book, George Dantzig looks at a wealth of examples and develops linear programming methods for their solutions. He begins by introducing the basic theory of linear inequalities and describes the powerful simplex method used to solve them. Treatments of the price concept, the transportation problem, and matrix methods are also given, and key mathematical concepts such as the properties of convex sets and linear vector spaces are covered. </p><p>George Dantzig is properly acclaimed as the "father of linear programming." Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a situation. It can be used to minimize traffic congestion or to maximize the scheduling of airline flights. He formulated its basic theoretical model and discovered its underlying computational algorithm, the "simplex method," in a pathbreaking memorandum published by the United States Air Force in early 1948. <i>Linear Programming and Extensions</i> provides an extraordinary account of the subsequent development of his subject, including research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems.</p><p> Dantzig first achieved success as a statistics graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. One day he arrived for a class after it had begun, and assumed the two problems on the board were assigned for homework. When he handed in the solutions, he apologized to his professor, Jerzy Neyman, for their being late but explained that he had found the problems harder than usual. About six weeks later, Neyman excitedly told Dantzig, "I've just written an introduction to one of your papers. Read it so I can send it out right away for publication." Dantzig had no idea what he was talking about. He later learned that the "homework" problems had in fact been two famous unsolved problems in statistics.</p>}},

The book's approach interweaves traditional topics with data analysis and reflects the use of the computer with close ties to the practice of statistics. The author stresses analysis of data, examines real problems with real data, and motivates the theory. The book's descriptive statistics, graphical displays, and realistic applications stand in strong contrast to traditional texts that are set in abstract settings.}},
